Predicting natural diseasters with Biological occurences

It has been found that animals act unnatural during or before a catastrophe is about to occur. In the case of an earthquake, reptiles like frogs and a lot of birds can sense the diseaster from an hour before to a week before. A research was conducted by biologist Dr Rachel Grant of the Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK. She was studying toads 74km away from an quake, a 6.3-magnitude event that struck close to L'Aquila city. She noticed their behaviour and has recorded their data. It was found that five days before the earthquake, the number of male common toads in the breeding colony fell by 96% and to 100% in the next two days. While spawn was found at the site up to six days before the earthquake, and again six days after it, no spawn was laid during the so-called earthquake period - the time from the first main shock to the last aftershock. 
This data was recorded by her and is available. We can harness this data as a training  data and train the system to predict earthquakes. We can also set up a few sensors and camera to record activities of frogs in diseaster prone areas so we can get even greater insight.


For the hackathon, we plan to use the data and try to predict the occurance of earthquakes.
